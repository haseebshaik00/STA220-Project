# STA220-Project | Unveiling Climate Vulnerability
## How Economic Strength, Demographic Dynamics, and Geographical Factors Shape Environmental Resilience

## 📊 Objective
- To identify key economic, demographic, and environmental drivers of climate vulnerability.
- Analyze data across two country groups — Top 10 most vulnerable and Bottom 10 least vulnerable (based on ND-GAIN).
- To generate insights for policymakers to guide climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

## 🔍 Research Questions
1. Do countries with higher GDP per capita tend to exhibit lower climate vulnerability?
2. How does a country’s expenditure on environmental protection influence its climate vulnerability?
3. Do countries with higher birth rates or younger populations have greater climate stress?
4. How do population density and urbanization influence climate vulnerability?
5. How does temperature change differ between the most and least vulnerable countries?
6. How do geo-environmental indicators like forest area, water reserves, and protected land affect climate vulnerability?

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data Acquisition: Static and Dynamic Crawling using `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, `LXML`, `Selenium`
- Data Processing: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- Visualization: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Choropleth Maps`
- Dataset Sources: UN Data, FAOSTAT, ClimateWatch, World Population Review, ISO Codes
